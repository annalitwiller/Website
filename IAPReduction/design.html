    <li class="sources">Test the performance of designs based on the experience of Zimbabwe
      residents who cook inside of their dwellings without proper ventilation
      and suffer from IAP.</li>
    <li class="sources">One square meter of discarded sheet metal 1mm thick was used to create
      several different units.</li>
    <li class="sources">The metal sheet was marked using some chalk to create fold lines and cut
      lines.</li>
    <li class="sources">The marked shapes were cut using sheet metal snips. The shapes were
      joining by folding the edges of the two-dimensional shapes to form threedimensional shapes.</li>
  </ul>
  Note: Pop rivets were used for speed, but the shapes can all be assembled using folded tabs.

 <h2> Design of Combustion Chamber: </h2>
The combustion chamber is designed in a
rectangular prism shape. In the combustion chamber fuel (wood pieces) are
combusted. It was observed that inner chamber became red hot. To reduce
the heat losses from inner chamber, a jacket of coarse sand and heat
resistance refractory material was added (Fire Clay). As shown in the figure
below.

  <h2>The Clean Cooking System has two components:</h2>
  <ol class="test3">
    <li>Stove “Cooker” to burn fuel more efficiently and
    reduce emitted smoke.</li>
    <li>Chimney and hood, to eliminate fumes from
    dwelling. The chimney is isolated from the roof
    by a 2nd outer pipe. Nails are used to isolate the
    chimney pipe from the insulating pipe and the roof.</li>
