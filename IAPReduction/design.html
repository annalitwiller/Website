  <ul class="test">
    <li>Test the performance of designs based on the experience of Zimbabwe
      residents who cook inside of their dwellings without proper ventilation
      and suffer from IAP.</li>
    <li>One square meter of discarded sheet metal 1mm thick was used to create
      several different units.</li>
    <li>The metal sheet was marked using some chalk to create fold lines and cut
      lines.</li>
    <li>The marked shapes were cut using sheet metal snips. The shapes were
      joining by folding the edges of the two-dimensional shapes to form threedimensional shapes.</li>
    <li>Note: Pop rivets were used for speed, but the shapes can all be
      assembled using folded tabs.</li>

  Design of Combustion Chamber: The combustion chamber is designed in a
rectangular prism shape. In the combustion chamber fuel (wood pieces) are
combusted. It was observed that inner chamber became red hot. To reduce
the heat losses from inner chamber, a jacket of coarse sand and heat
resistance refractory material was added (Fire Clay). As shown in the figure
below.
